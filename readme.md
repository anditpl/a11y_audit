# Accessibility Audit Automation Program

## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to the **Accessibility Audit Automation Program**, a tool developed by **≈Åukasz Krause** for automating accessibility audits on websites using **Playwright** and [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) integration.

This program generates detailed accessibility reports in **HTML** and **JSON** formats, based on **WCAG levels (A, AA, AAA)**. It also supports auditing specific accessibility roles, providing a summary of accessibility violations to improve web accessibility.

## ‚ö° Features
- **Batch Auditing:** Automatically detects `sites.json` with websites urls for auditing multiple websites.
- **Local HTML Support:** Audits local HTML files from the `local_pages` folder.
- **Error Handling:** Handles unreachable websites gracefully.
- **Customizable Audits:** Allows customization of audit levels and roles.
- **Multiple Role Support:** Accepts multiple roles (comma-separated).
- **Comprehensive Reports:** Generates detailed reports in **HTML** and **JSON** formats.
- **Best Practices Tag:** Each WCAG level includes the `best-practice` tag.
- **Highlighted Screenshots:** Screenshots with highlighted accessibility violations (in **JPG** format) are generated.
- **Command-Line Support:** Run audits by passing website URLs directly via CLI.
- **PDF Summary Report:** Generates a combined **PDF** report summarizing key findings for all audited sites.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important 
Automated accessibility testing should be treated as a complementary step. For comprehensive accessibility assurance, manual testing is essential.
